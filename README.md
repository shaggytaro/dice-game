# dice-game

This is a dice game created by me using vanilla JavaScript. In this project, i have used concepts like if-else statement and query selectors. This game is about comparing two dices and the winner will be declared if player 1's dice has a number more than the number of player 2's dice. For example, if player got a 6 and player 2 got a 4, then player 1 wins. The concept of query selectors have been used to change the headers of the project. There is a concept of a tie as well.

I hope that you can enjoy the game!
